# Revamped Piglin Idea
  - [Pride]: The more gold items you carry in your inventory, worn, or held, the less damage you'll receive from any source. You can mitigate up to 90% of damage received this way.
  - [Boasting Firepower]: Your melee attack inflicts additional damage equivalent to 10% of the damage you've dealt. Further increases the additional damage dealt by 10% per nearby entities present within 6 blocks.
  - [Courage]: You are immune from weakness and wither status effects.
  - [Gluttony]: You get even more hungry than usual when replenishing health.
  - [Nether Inhabitant]: Your natural spawn will be in the Nether.

# Revamped Elven Idea
  - [Lifeweaver]: Immediately regenerates health based on the accumulated damage taken within 3 seconds upon receiving it. Then, grants absorption for 12 seconds that scales depending on the amount of damage received.
  - [Endless Quiver]: When wielding a bow in hand and you don't have any arrows in your inventory, automatically grants one for yourself.
  - [Imbue]: Enhances your projectiles to deal additional damage equivalent to 50% of your current health, plus 25% of their max health if the target is undead. This additional damage is treated as magic and will bypass armor.
  - [Agility]: Become nimble and swift, granting you increased movement speed and jump height, enabling you to traverse the terrain effortlessly.
  - [Pearmeable]: You take 10% more damage from any source.

# Revamped Voidwalker Idea
  - [Beelzebub]: Melee attacks will deal additional damage based on your missing health. Charges one stack of [Beelzebub] on attack, up to three.
  - [Soulburst]: When [Beelzebub] reaches three stacks, consumes all of it, and deals additional damage based on the total damage dealt when acquiring the stacks. 
  - [Umbral Veil]: Shrouds yourself in a dark energy when sprinting, granting additional speed and avoiding any projectile damage.
  - [Sinister Aura]: Nearby passive mobs are frightened with your presence, and will run away from you.
  - [Life Drain]: Whenever you deal damage, your health is reduced by the target's missing health, up to 50% of your max health. When your health is equal to 1, this will not reduce any further.

# Diviner Origin Idea
  - [Prescience]: Punch with the ability selected to cast on up to two other players. Upon cast, increases both you and the other player's max health by 50% of all of your health combined.
  - [Oracle]: When players under the effect of [Prescience] you've casted, took any damage or received healing, it will be distributed among you and the other players.
  - [Aegis]: Any external damage taken directly will deflect 50% of the damage back to the attacker. This ability will not trigger on attackers wherein you have casted [Prescience] on.
  - [Divine Aura]: Players under the effect of [Prescience] will glow, and can be seen through walls.
  - [Fragility]: The less health you have, the more damage you will take.
  - [Instability]: For every unique status effect applied to you, your max health will be reduced by 1. When your health is equal to 1, this will not reduce any further.

# re-write everything to scripts
# do not use experimental features
# avoid overwriting vanilla entries whenever possible


# revamped Elven
  - every time you shoot someone using a projectile arrow, another homing projectile will chase after it dealing additional damage. this can only be triggered once every 5 seconds.
  - 

# do the trailer

# improve soul lock ability

# do the Rancher
  - propagate entity event changes to all entities with the entity born event

# do the Voidwalker

# visually, something is missing with the Elven origin - especially the Invigorate ability. its supposed to feel more magical, something soothing. but at the moment, it doesn't

# use the new cooldown system

# add new cooldown handler from backend

# yeah maybe just move the bubble_rend to the side under the horse_heart_rend since horse_heart_rend offsets up anyway for some reason

# tweak camera to hide the body from the one whose viewing it

# implement new Origins
  - Elf
  - Voidwalker

# rework current cooldown system 

# implement custom origin presets
  - up to five unique custom presets can be added
  - in each preset, players can add existing traits and weaknesses (for example, they can add the starborne abilities + elytrian abilities)
  - more traits and weaknesses will also be added, for which they can add to their custom origin presets - thats not available on existing origins
  - easier said than done 



# fix some bugs - Insomniadic's contribution is noticeable (replace BP/entities/ folder)
# fix starborne trait [Nonviolent] not actually doing anything

# apply piglin defense component groups depending on `piglindefs` objective count

# fix class bugs

# add piglin origin

# down \/
# add protection on the administrative options tab. players need a specific tag (or enter a pin) before they can access it and a unique screen stating that they cannot access it.

# currently randomizer bypasses banned origins - needs fix

# world index scoreboard needs to be setup when joining the world

# make classes bannable
# add evict selection functionality
# add toggles
# make emit particle toggle function
# do the piglin origin
# fix bugs

# added piglin ref on UI/UX
# implement origin and class banning system
# implement options menu which can be triggered on the origins menu and then selecting slot number 5
# UI brainstorming: thinking of the side panel UI thats similar to the character creator screen

# finalisations and bug fixes left
# just some cooldown bar tweaks needed: A.) hide the active abilities when full; and B.) offset the shooting star cooldown bar properly when the leaping cooldown is not visible 

# starborne should have the smoke texture particle (in purple-blue gradient) instead of the fireworks particle

# starborne would have a unique cast method:
# the starborne can trigger up to two active abilities at a time. once if at least one is triggered, it would temporarily put a hold onto the stress trait, hide it and then be able to focus on skill casting.
# once all active abilities' cooldown has been finished, return back the stress.
  - HYPER LEAP: once triggered, the next jumps will be imbued with cosmic power, allowing the player to leap towards a direction. this is a toggleable skill. cooldown is started once the player comes into contact with ground
  - SHOOTING STAR: once triggered, the next punch will be imbued with cosmic power, allowing the player to shoot a beam towards a direction they are looking at. similar to how the Enderian Pearl is cast

# might just be saved for the next update:
  [ ABILITY CHOICE #1 ]
  - CELESTIAL SHIELD: once triggered, you will become immune from all incoming projectiles for a few seconds
  - STAR DASH: once triggered, you temporarily gain increased movement speed, slowing anyone that comes into your path
  - STELLAR STRIKE: once triggered, you will fire a light beam from the skies towards a direction you are looking at
  - ASTRONOMIC BLAST: once triggered, all your collected stress will be converted into energy, releasing it and affecting nearby entities, power scales on the collected energy when this is used
  - COSMIC FLARES: once triggered, the next punch will fire a beam similar to SHOOTING STAR towards a direction you are looking at, after impact it will split into multiple projectiles nearby
  - GRAVITATIONAL DOME: once triggered, will cancel the gravity within your vicinity, allowing nearby entities to float

  [ ABILITY CHOICE #2 ]
  - COSMIC WISDOM: is a passive skill, which when obtained, allows you to meditate and ease stress even when moving

Changelog (v4.0):

  This update brings you the latest 1.20 support for Minecraft Bedrock, two new Origins to choose, 1 new class to select, and a ton of bug fixes and improvements to see.

  [ New Origin: Elven ]
    Elegant and agile beings with a deep connection to nature, skilled in archery and long-range combat. Capable of invoking magic - mending wounds and invigorate beings.

      - [Yggdrasil's Branch]: You can create a link between you and another mob or player, granting your passive traits to the entity you are linked with.
      - [Shared Senses]: By using this active skill, you can look into the eyes of the mob or player you have linked with.
      - [Golden Lifespan]: Expands your life aura to the surrounding environment. Healing every mob and player around you while hostile and undead mobs are inflicted with damage.
      - [Nature's Grace]: You will continuously replenish health and hunger whenever you are in forest biomes.
      - [Agility]: Become nimble and swift, granting you increased movement speed and jump height, enabling you to traverse the terrain effortlessly.
      - [Focused Aim]: You inflict increased projectile damage from ranged weapons such as bow and crossbows when they are fully drawn.

  [ New Origin: Voidwalker ]
    Born in the depths of a sinister realm, you have acquired the ability to manipulate and harness dark energies to harm and hinder others.

      - [Beelzebub]: Absorb the deaths of mobs that are slain within your vicinity as dark energy. Which can be utilized in your other abilities.
      - [Soulreap]: Invokes a curse on the nearest player, temporarily weakening their attacks, and rendering them incapable of using their active abilities for a while. Requires a full bar of dark energy to use.
      - [Umbral Veil]: Shrouds yourself in a dark energy when sprinting, granting additional speed and absorbing any projectile damage. Sneak and then jump (or sneak while in mid-air) to trigger aerial movement. Requires dark energy to use.
      - [Gift of the Abyss]: You gain additional attack damage whenever you are in dark places.
      - [Nocturnal Sight]: You can see clearly in low-light conditions, granting you night vision without the need for potions or external light sources.
      - [Sinister Aura]: Nearby mobs are frightened with your presence, and will run away from you. Even hostile mobs, except bosses, will not try and naturally harm Voidwalkers.

  [ New Class: Rancher ]
    Making the most of animals, Ranchers are able to gather many useful resources.

      - [More Births]: Animals bred when you are around have a chance to produce up to three babies.
      - [Scavenging]: You are able to sometimes receive more material from killing mobs.

  [ Origin Adjustments ]

    [ Avian ]
      - Optimized [Vegetarian] trait to make food items non-interactable in the first place instead.

    [ Arachnid ]
      - Optimized [Carnivore] trait to make food items non-interactable in the first place instead.

    [ Shulk ]
      - Increased gameplay impact value from "easy" to "medium".
      - Hunger status effect given by [Large Appetite] now expires immediately after getting full health.
      - Fixed an issue whereby the [Shulk Inventory] trait is not opening the inventory properly.

    [ Enderian ]
      - Opimized [Teleportation] trait to follow vanilla ender pearl behavior and physics.

    [ Phantom ]
      The Phantom's unique abilities allowed players to traverse with ease in distant places and escape situations others may not able to. This change aims to add a limit to this ability in order to promote fairness.

      - Nerfed [Phantom Form] trait:
        - Added [Essence Drift], a trait that adds a traversal drawback to this trait
        - Added another cooldown bar to show this drawback
        - Reduced movement speed when travelling in phantomized form
      - Updated skin overlay when using this Origin.

    [ Fox ]
      - Changed name from "Spirit Fox" to "Fox".

    [ Slimecican ]
      The Slimecican was a capable tank that was able to take damage and knock enemies away. However, I felt that it was much stronger than I expected and deserved a bit of change.

      - Adjusted [Fragmentation] trait:
        - Increased maximum player health by default as an effect of this trait
        - When the player's health is at 50% over the max health, they'll shrink in size
        - This trait will no longer prevent the player from dying but instead make the player adapt its stats depending on the health it has
        - Removed several damage resistance and mitigation
      - Updated skin overlay when using this Origin.
      - Fixed health glitch whereby this Origin causes the player to be invulnerable.

    [ Inchling ]
      - Camera perspective is now more accurate.

    [ Bee ]
      - Increased cooldown before the [Poisonous] trait can be used again from 1 second to 2 seconds.

    [ Piglin ]
      I realized that players find it difficult to trigger and therefore benefit from the Piglin's unique traits under conditions with no players nearby. Therefore, I decided to enhance its capabilities so it can adapt to any situation.

      - Buffed [Resilience] trait:
        - Changed name to [Tenacity]
        - Will now trigger upon killing other mobs as well instead of just players
        - Increased damage mitigation from 50% up to 90%
      - Increased base attack damage given by the [Boasting Firepower] trait from 2 to 4.

    [ Starborne ]
      The Starborne provided the players a great combo of mobility and long-range combat with its adaptive abilities. This change is to hopefully make the players focus more on the [Stress] trait mechanics.

      - Adjusted [Stress] trait:
        - Increased time to reduce [Stress] from perfoming [Meditate]
        - Rate at which [Stress] increases is now the same regardless of any situation
        - Cooldown of other skills are now decreased when the [Stress] is at 70% instead of 50%
        - Updated cooldown bar look to show the mark beyond the 70% threshold
      - Adjusted [Hyper Leap] trait:
        - Optimized the direction and accuracy of dashes
        - Has been simplified and can no longer be consecutively be triggered, but offers a fairly short cooldown before each use
        - Ability can no longer be triggered while the [Shooting Star] ability is in cooldown
      - Buffed [Shooting Star] trait:
        - Increased the number of projectiles that fires upon use
        - Changed damage type from `entity_explosion` to `magic`
        - Can now explode mid-air without targets but deals less damage
        - Ability can no longer be triggered while the [Hyper Leap] ability is in cooldown

      - Improved [Vegetarian] trait.
      - With changes in world height, you now need to sleep at an altitude of 151 blocks (previously 86) with the [Fresh Air] trait in effect. Also improved consistency of this trait.

      - Improved [Webbing] effects and buffed it's effects. Additionally now works against other players, unless if they are that of the Archnid Origin.
      - [Webbing] will no longer trigger if you immediately kill the target.
      - Changed [Venom Resistance] to [Web Cocoon], allowing you to mitigate up to 50% of any damage taken as long as you're standing in a cobweb.

    • Elytrian
      - [Gift of the Winds] improved triggering with new touch control schemes.

      - Added [Sea Inhabitant] trait which will prevent underwater mobs from naturally attacking the [Merling] Origin. 
      - Added [Conduit Power] trait where previously multiple traits are simply combined into this one.
      - Added [Ocean's Gift] trait which makes it immune from any trident damage.
      - You now get a temporary water breathing upon choosing this Origin, so you can have a headstart.
      - Now part of the "fish" mob-type family.
      - Tweaked status effects being granted when being underwater or not.
      - Fixed an issue where after changing from the [Merling] Origin, you would still be able to breathe underwater.
    • Blazeborn
      - Added [Burning Wrath] trait which buffs the blazeborn if it's on fire as it was originally designed.
      - Tweaked [Nether Inhabitant] trait's teleporter to the nether so that it is more stable and consistent.
      - Removed the [Fireball] trait due to crash reported issues.
    • Phantom
      - Adjusted [Phatom Form] trait -- uses the new "spectator" mode.
      - Replaced [Fast Metabolism] trait with the new [Perish] trait, which offers a better downside to the [Phantom Form] to balance it out.
      - [Spiritual Body] - or the [Invisibility] - trait now behaves as if you were not there, and cannot be attacked nor punched. But at the same time you can't be able to do it to others too. 
      - [Photoallergic] has been turned into the [Undead] trait, not only limiting your access to daylight but also healing effects.
      - You now get a temporary fire resistance so as to not immediately burn from the daylight once you pick this Origin.
      - Fixed an issue where due to the effects of the [Photoallergic] trait, causes the player to burn in daylight even in creative mode.

  [ Technical & UI Changes ]

      - Added additional screens for changing, picking, and viewing classes.
      - Added ability icons next to trait names to show if it's an active ability you can trigger.
      - Added a mix of item AUX ID and item texture rendering for Origin/class icons.
      - Improved user interface layout for changing Origins and classes.
      - Improved controller/keyboard support with button mapping.
      - Improved scrollbar appearance.
      - Tweaked when changing current Origin so that it would first display which Origin you were previously.
      - Tweaked button placements to match the Java mod.
      - Removed some unecessary texts, and "+", "-", and "=" sprites as it was too gimmicky.
      - Removed dirt background.
    • Cooldown bar:
      - Up to 2 concurrent bars can now be visible.
      - Texture parity to the Java mod.
      - Will now dynamically offset depending on the situation.
    • Added a star icon next to some custom-made items that require more attention.
    • Added welcome pop-up information upon player joining. This is persistent even after rejoining, and has a vital reason for existing.
    • Added new particle effects!

    • You can no longer change your Origin/class if there's an active cooldown running.
    • Updated file paths and rewritten JSON UI code & structure.

    • UI dialogue is now triggered within the player's NPC component and no longer requires a seperate ticking NPC entity.
  
  [ Bug Fixes ]
    • Fixed where the cooldown bar is sometimes is in the incorrect offset.
    • Fixed an issue where buttons won't work properly. This is an issue on the game's end and only a workaround has simply been made to counter this.
    • Fixed a bug where the bubble renderer would still render regardless if you're underwater or not.
    • Fixed a bug where Origin traits would not properly function when rejoining.
    • Fixed an issue where player component groups would have lingering artifacts of other component groups causing multiple unintended behaviour.
    • Fixed Origin icons not showing the proper icon image on the picker screen.
    • Fixed incorrect version "gamma" specified on the pack's manifest.

  [ Known Issues ]
    • May require a pretty beefy host to have a better experience in playing with this add-on in multiplayer.
    • Uses [player.json] in order to further improve gameplay experience, this means it will not be compatible with other add-ons that use the [player.json]. Otherwise, it should work for that add-on as well.
    • Origin/class picker screen does not act as a menu and has some weird touch behaviours. This is due to how JSON UI screen's property cannot be dynamically changed.
    • Incorrect death message for when the [Merling] Origin has dried out.
    • Cooldown bar is situated more on the client-side than it is with the server-side and thus may not be in sync.
    • Cooldown bar is not retained when changing away from the HUD screen.
    • Potion names are fixed (not dynamic) and cannot be localized.
    • Camera view is not adjusted properly whenever the player is scaled down or up. This due to technical limitations as of the moment.
    • Sometimes the [Slimecican] Origin will completely become invulnerable from any damage. Just leave and re log them back into the world to fix it.
    • [Carnivore] nad [Vegetarian] traits would sometimes still allow the player to eat or consume food items they are not supposed to. This will be fixed in the future.
    • Movement controls are accessible on touch on Origin picker screens.

  [ Localization ]
    • Localization support, for the time being, has been removed due to many changes implemented in this update. It will be back once it is settled in.
